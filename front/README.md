## Linter
Our ESLint is based on a standard that was given by our client and we improved it with these additional features to have a more elegant codebase that resembles to our coding style.

Additional features on linter: 
- add a blankline if the const is multiline
-  block-spacing, comma-spacing, comma-dangle, object-curly-newline, space-infix-ops
