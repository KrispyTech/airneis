## Burnup Report

This overview of the Burnup report allows us to visualise the work accomplished during a sprint and compare it to the total scope of the sprint.

For this second sprint, we can see for the work completed a curve that is slowly rising. We took a long time to finish the ORM setup, which was a real challenge for us. Once the ORM setup was complete, we were able to move on to the other tasks from 13 February.
After that, we increased the number of tasks completed, while keeping the number of points constant.
