## Summary

Store our data in a shared DB

## Context

We will need to store our data into a shared database, accessible from our deployment. We do not need a lot of storage, but we do need simplicity and availability

## Solution

### NeonDB

Neon is an open source serverless Postgres with a free plan available. It includes some useful features such as the possibility of creating branches of our dabatase.

Neon free tier plan allows:

- 10 branches
- 3GiB per branch
- 100h hour of Active time per month

It should be enough for our needs, especially considering that when all our Active time is consumed, only non-primary branches are suspended, while our primary branch remains available.

#### How to authenticate:

When creating a Neon DB, it provides you with a classic connection string such as:

```
postgresql://neon.rejoin138:0Ydy7spFeJCr@ep-polished-poetry-a2pjwv5m.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/test?sslmode=require
```

We could then store our password in our Vault to connect in a secure manner.

### How connect to our App:

Neon provides useful guides for different langages and framework, including Go.

The following exemple is offered:

```
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"

    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
    connStr := "postgres://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", connStr)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    var version string
    if err := db.QueryRow("select version()").Scan(&version); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("version=%s\n", version)
}
```
