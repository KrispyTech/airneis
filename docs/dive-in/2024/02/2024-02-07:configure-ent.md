# Configure ent and atlas dive-in

## SUMMARY:
We want to declare a schema of our database and this schema to be applied to the database.
But we don't want it to be like dark magic. We want to have some control over it.
As we are using golang for our backend we think about using gorm and atlas to achieve that.

## SOLUTION:

Atlas offers a clean to do versioned migrations.

To declare your schema with gorm you can create a struct that represent a table where each attribute is a column.
That's a pretty nice way of declaring schema as we will be able to use those structs as our types.

```go
package model

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type User struct {
gorm.Model
Name    string `json:"name" gorm:"unique"`
Age     int    `json:"age"`
IsAdmin bool   `json:"isAdmin"`
}

type Car struct {
gorm.Model
Owner       User   `json:"owner" gorm:"-"`
Constructor string `json:"constructor"`
ModelName   string `json:"modelName"`
}
```

To make the migrations we will use Atlas.
First you need to install it. You can use homebrew for macos or your favorite package manager if you are using linux
To set it up create an ```atlas.hcl``` file following this example

```hcl

data "external_schema" "gorm" {
  program = [
    "go",
    "run",
    "-mod=mod",
    "ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm",
    "load",
    "--path", "./model",
    "--dialect", "postgres", // | postgres | sqlite | sqlserver
  ]
}

env "gorm" {
  src = data.external_schema.gorm.url
  dev = "Your dev database uri" # Don't forget to add sslmode=disable if ssl is not enable and search_path=public as queries string
  url =  "Your database uri" # In local it can be the same url
  migration {
    dir = "file://migrations" 
  }
  format {
    migrate {
      diff = "{{ sql . \"  \" }}"
    }
  }
}


```

To create a migration run the following command

```shell
 atlas migrate diff  migration_name --env gorm   
```

To apply the migration run

```shell
atlas migrate apply --env gorm
```

# PROBLEMS

When trying to rollback a migration or trying to create a second migration I have this error

The best I was able to do was to clear all the database  by running this command

```shell 
atlas schema clean -u "dburi"
```
