## SUMMARY:

We wan to have our code linted and tested automatically when pushed. As we our code is hosted on Github, we will use Github Actions to do so.

## CONTEXT:

Having code linted and tested is a good practice and will help us maintaining a clean and working codebase. We it to be done automatically when code is push to be sure that the code merged into staging to be deployed is working and clean. It will also help the reviewers.
