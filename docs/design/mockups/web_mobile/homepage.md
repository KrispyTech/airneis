The home page is the main page that customers access when they visit from our website or our mobile phone.

The first part of the mock-up is "The Highlanders of the moment":
- It represents the current categories that have been determined in the back office.

The second part of the mock-up represents the category cards:
- Each card contains the category's image and the title.
On this page, we can see all the categories and choose the category we like to see all the related products.
