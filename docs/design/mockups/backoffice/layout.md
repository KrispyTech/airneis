# Layout Mockup

![Layout Mockup](./images/layout.png)

This is the main layout that will be used for all other pages in our back-office.
We can see the header, which contains "Ã€IRNEIS" and "Back Office".

There is also a lateral bar which contains all back office navigations.

The first part of the lateral bar is the "Product Management":

- Products: To see all products in a table and manage them.
- Categories: To see all categories in a table and manage them.
- Higlanders: To manage "The Highlanders of the moment" in a table and choose the order in which they appear.
- Orders: To manage the orders in a table and manage them.

The second part of the lateral bar is the "User Management":

- Users: To manage all users in a table that have a connection on the web or mobile.
- Contacts: To manage forms written by the users.
