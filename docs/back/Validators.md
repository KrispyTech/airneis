# BACKEND VALIDATION

In order to have coherent data in our db we need to use validators in our ap√Æ.
To do so we will be using this package [GitHub kink of the package](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)

# Create a rule

It's very simple tou can follow this example:
To have a Name that is required and with a length from 2 to 50 characters do this

```go
type Human struct {

Name string  ` validate:"required,min=2,max=50"`
}
```

See how easy it is and if you want to check you can follow this example:

```go
if err := validator.ValidateInput(yourVar); err != nil {
return helpers.SetStatusAndMessages(constants.BadRequestStatus, err.Error(), ctx)
}
```
