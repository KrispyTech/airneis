# DEPENDENCIES (optional)
If your PR needs another PR to be merged before please specify here (we won't be able to guess it, so please don't forget).

# DONE 

Tell everyone what you have done. You may include screenshots if it will help the team 
to understand what you have done.

Answer to those questions if needed:   
    - What have changed?  
    - How did you do?  
    - Why have you done that?  


# TEST

Because trust doesn't exclude control we will need to test what you have done.  
So in order to help the reviewer please explain what he will have to do to test you PR.  
If a manipulation is necessary to make the code work like adding an env variable or to apply migration specify it in this section.  
Try to cover as many possibilities as you can to prevent bugs.

If you fix a bug you should explain how the bug occurred to help the reviewer to be sure the bug is fix.

Answer those questions:
    - What should I do before testing your PR ?
    - How can I test you PR ?
    - Which difficulties I could face ?
